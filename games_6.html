	Blockperson in HyperCubeWorld is a sequel to <a href="games_5.html">Blockperson in Cubeworld</a><br/>
	I am currently working on a much larger sequel, which is currently on hiatus due to depression about a significant bug that I need to fix and then reimplement every single environmental puzzle in the whole world.
	<br/>
	That last bit is quite daunting given my general lack of energy after getting home from work.<br/>
	In the meantime, please enjoy this one :)
