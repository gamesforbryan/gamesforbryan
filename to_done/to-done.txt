to-done is a simple project tracking system for single person or very small teams.  It uses plain text files (or even paper) to track your tasks.

Basic:
- Put each task on its own line.
- Put a hyphen next to the task if it needs doing.
~ Put a tilde next to the taks if it is in progress.
- Any task...
	- ... can have 1...
	- ... or more child tasks.
~ Put the parent task in progress...
	~ ... if the child task is in progress.
! Sometimes, we want to just say something without it being an task.
! So, we put an exclamation mark to show that this is just a note.
? Other times, we're not sure whether we need to do something or not, so we put a question mark.
X If we decide not to do something, we put an X.
	! Maybe, we even put a note why we decided not to do that task.
+ Finally, when an task is done, we use the plus sign.
	! If you are using this system on paper, the hyphen very easily turns into a plus
	
Advanced:
- Keep 1 todo.txt file and 1 done.txt file.
- Move big chunks of completed tasks to done.txt whenever you need a motivation boost.
- If a task seems too large to take on, break it up into smaller child tasks.
	- Make each child task small enough to manage
		? Or, maybe break the child task into smaller child tasks.
- Don't spend so much time wrangling your list that you're not spending time doing work.
	- Work on your current tasks for at least 15 minutes a day, no matter how tired or grumpy you feel after work.
	! However, if you're not feeling creative, managing your list is better than skipping a day
