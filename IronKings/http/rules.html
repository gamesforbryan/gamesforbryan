<br/>The Rules of Engagement for Iron Kings
<br/>
<br/>Overview: The very earth quakes as ancient war machines are awakened by modern Medieval mechanics and set loose upon the ruins of the "Balrog Zone" to see what plunder they can bring back to their Holdfast.
<br/>
<br/>Set Up:
<br/>- Randomly assign Player 1.  Give them the "First Player" token.  Play proceeds clockwise from First Player.
<br/>- In player order, each player picks their starting position and places their Holdfast and Iron King on their starting position.
<br/>- Shuffle all of the decks.
<br/>- Each player draws 5 planning cards.
<br/>
<br/>On Your Turn:
<br/>- If any of your workers are placed on the map and not adjacent to your Iron King's hex, put them in the Wilderness.
<br/>- If you have no workers in the rested box OR you have a worker on the Brake space, take all of your workers currently placed on the player board and on the map adjacent to your IK and put them in the rested box.
<br/>    - If your IK is currently positioned on your Holdfast, also take all of your workers currently in the Wilderness and put them in the rested box.
<br/>- Place 1 worker on any Legal Space and resolve its effect.
<br/>- If there is a worker on the Throttle and not on the Brake, also resolve their IK phase.
<br/>
<br/>Ending the Game:
<br/>? VP goal
<br/>? X turns after Balrog rises
<br/>? X turns
<br/>
<br/>Spaces:
<br/>Holdfast: A player selects the location for this piece during set up.  Returning their IK to this space is how they can cash in their treasures for extra VP, rescue squires from the Wilderness, upgrade, and repair.
<br/>Repair (HF): Unlimited worker placement.  Otherwise, same as Repair (IK)
<br/>Wilderness:  If a worker is on this space, they have survived a near-mishap and are on their way through the Wilderness back to their Holdfast.
<br/>Rested Box:  If a worker is on this space, the player may take one and place it in a Legal Space during their worker placement phase.
<br/>Throttle: If a worker is on this space, then at the end of the player's worker placement phase, they'll resolve their IK phase.
<br/>Brake:  If a worker is on this space, then no IK phase for this player.  See turn rules for additional sequence of events.
<br/>Build Steam: Spend pairs of water and wood to generate 3 steam per pair.  Spend pairs of water and coal to generate 4 steam per pair.
<br/>            You cannot build more steam than your max steam meter.  Any steam generated in excess is wasted.
<br/>Draw 2 & Plan 1:  Draw 2 planning cards into your hand.  Then "Plan 1".
<br/>Repair:  Place 1 worker to remove 1 damage counter.  Also spend 1 iron to remove 2 damage counters.
<br/>Map Hex:
<br/>    Players can place workers on map hexes adjacent to their IK in order to resolve the effect on that hex.
<br/>    Many of these hexes can only be harvested a set number of times, indicated by the stack of tokens placed on the hex at the start of the game.
<br/>        Forest: Harvest wood (Take one wood token)
<br/>        Mountain: Harvest coal (Take one coal token)
<br/>        Barrow: Harvest coal (Take one coal token)
<br/>        Ruins: Harvest coal (Take one coal token)
<br/>        Lake: Harvest water (Take one water token from the bag)
<br/>        
<br/>    Players can maneuver their IKs onto a hex for a different effect.
<br/>    NOTE: IK Must Step onto hex to trigger effect.  Merely turning in place or being Pushed onto a hex does not trigger an effect.
<br/>    NOTE: One exception to this is any hex that is purple with a skull & crossbones, which will still inflict 1 damage.
<br/>    Note, the effect is triggered regardless of whether the player desires it or not.
<br/>        Forest: +1 Defense
<br/>        Mountain: +1 Defense/+1 Attack.  Cannot step onto mountain, only Climb or Leap.  Planning cards that would attempt to step into a Mountain space still cost Steam but do not move the IK.
<br/>        Barrow:  Draw two tokens.
<br/>        Mine: Draw three tokens, keep 2.  Take 1 damage.
<br/>        Ruins: Draw two tokens, keep 1.
<br/>        Lake: Take 2 water. Must immediately stop IK round.
<br/>        Wasteland: Take 1 damage.
<br/>        
<br/>Legal Space:
<br/>    A Space with fewer workers than its limit that is on the Player Board or on a Map Hex adjacent to their Iron King.
<br/>    
<br/>Planning:
<br/>You may see text that says "Plan 1".
<br/>This means that you may insert a planning card into any position in the planning stack, pushing the rest of the stack to the right.
<br/>This means that you may remove one planning card from any position in the planning stack, putting the card into the planning discard pile.
<br/>This means that you may replace one planning card in the planning stack with one from your hand, putting the old card into the planning discard pile.
<br/>
<br/>Executing Plans:
<br/>    Next to each Player Board is the Planning Track, representing preprogrammed movements that your IK will execute if it has the following:
<br/>        - Enough Steam to pay for the card (Steam cost is in the top-right of each Planning Card).
<br/>        - The ability to resolve the card (e.g. the card requires an item to be equipped, and your IK has one).
<br/>        - A worker currently placed on the Throttle or an equivalent status.
<br/>    Then do this:
<br/>    - Spend the Steam. 
<br/>    - Resolve the Planning card's effect.
<br/>    - Advance the instruction pointer.
<br/>    - Repeat until Steam < Planning card's Steam cost or the instruction pointer has moved off past the end of the stack.
<br/>    
<br/>Stepping on Workers:
<br/>    If your IK moves into the same space as a worker, that worker is placed in the Wilderness space.
<br/>    
<br/>Pushing:
<br/>    If resolving a Planning Card would move one IK into another's space, and there is space behind the other's IK, then the other's IK is pushed back one space in the direction of the active player's IK, without changing facing.
<br/>    
<br/>Combat:
<br/>   If the Pusher has a weapon equipped, and its Attack Value is higher than the other's Defense Value, then place that Attack minus Defense many damage tokens.
<br/>   Example:  My IK has an Attack of 1 due to a sword it is carrying.  The other player's IK has no defense.  They will place 1 Damage Token on their IK.
<br/>   My IK has an attack of 3 due to a really good sword it is carrying.  The other player's IK has a combined Defense of 3.  My sword will not damage their IK.
<br/>   
<br/>Placing Damage Tokens:
<br/>   Pips on die correspond to worker spaces on IK player board (Two worker spaces in each section x 3 sections).
<br/>   If there's a worker in the space that is damaged, place that worker in the Wilderness.
<br/>   In each section, the right-hand worker spaces have an additional effect when damage tokens are placed on them.
<br/>   - Head, remove 1 planning card from the stack
<br/>   - Body, lose 2 steam
<br/>   - Legs, if Brake is damaged, Throttle is always ON
<br/>   If a position is rolled that is already occupied by a damage token, then the damage token spills over to the next spot until it lands on an empty spot.  
<br/>   If the IK has all 6 spaces damaged and gets another damage token, it is completely destroyed and the player is out of the game.
<br/>   None of the spaces covered by damage tokens can be used.
<br/>   
<br/>Repairing Damage:
<br/>   It takes 1 Repair action to fix up to 1 damage.  1 Repair action + 1 Iron can fix up to 2 damage.
<br/>   
<br/>Treasure:
<br/>    Treasure cards take up an equipment slot.  They can be scrapped to make room for a different treasure.
<br/>    Some treasures give resources when scrapped (e.g. coal, iron, wood).
<br/>    Returning a treasure to your Holdfast grants you twice the victory points.  Treasures held by IK at game end are worth normal VP amount.
<br/>    
<br/>Upgrade:
<br/>    Upgrade cards are placed directly over the section they are upgrading.    
<br/>    Once upgraded, a section cannot be downgraded.
